A work in progress project, aiming to create a website that shows the user what produce is grown locally, is currently in season, and its location. I am currently implementing possible features such as the ability for public input to keep the site up to date. The overall project is motivated by a desire to increase in-person connection and accessibility to fresh, healthy options in ways that also uplift vital aspects of our community.
